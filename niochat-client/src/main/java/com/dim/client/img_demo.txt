You're making things difficult for yourself by having a very confusing program structure, and I suggest that you simplify things a lot.

For one, there's no need for your current MinesweeperMenu class to extend MinesweeperPanel, and for the latter class to extend JFrame. Then you have a static JFrame somewhere else -- that's too many JFrames, and to boot, you're trying to display your image in one JFrame but showing the other one that doesn't have the picture. Your program needs just one JFrame and it should probably be created, stuffed with its contents, packed and displayed in one place, not scattered here and there as you're doing.

You're trying to display the picture in a paintComponent override, but this method will never get called since your class extends JFrame (eventually) and JFrame doesn't have this method. You're using the right method, but the class should be extending JPanel, and you should have an @Override annotation above the paintComponent method block to be sure that you're actually overriding a parent method.

You should get rid of all static everything in this program. The only thing static here should be the main method and perhaps some constants, but that's it.

There are more errors here, and I have tootoo little time to go over all of them. Consider starting from the beginning, starting small, getting small bits to work, and then adding them together.

For instance, first create a very small program that tries to read in an image into an Image object, place it in a ImageIcon, place the ImageIcon into a JLabel, and display the JLabel in a JOptionPane, that simple, just to see if you can read in images OK, for example, something like this:
import java.awt.image.BufferedImage;
import java.io.File;
import java.io.IOException;

import javax.imageio.ImageIO;
import javax.swing.ImageIcon;
import javax.swing.JLabel;
import javax.swing.JOptionPane;

public class TestImages {

   // *** your image path will be different *****
   private static final String IMG_PATH = "src/images/image01.jpg";

   public static void main(String[] args) {
      try {
         BufferedImage img = ImageIO.read(new File(IMG_PATH));
         ImageIcon icon = new ImageIcon(img);
         JLabel label = new JLabel(icon);
         JOptionPane.showMessageDialog(null, label);
      } catch (IOException e) {
         e.printStackTrace();
      }
   }
}

       try {                
          image = ImageIO.read(new File("image name and path"));
       } catch (IOException ex) {
            // handle exception...
       }
    }

    @Override
    protected void paintComponent(Graphics g) {
        super.paintComponent(g);
        g.drawImage(image, 0, 0, null); // see javadoc for more info on the parameters            
    }
